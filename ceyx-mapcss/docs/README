FAQ

*  What does Ceyx mean? 

    The first mapcss implementation is called halcyon. Now, let me
    quote wikipedia on Ceyx::

      In Greek mythology Ceyx (Ancient Greek: Κήϋξ Kēüx; English
      pronunciation: /ˈsiː.ɪks/) was the son of Eosphorus and the king
      of Thessaly. He was married to Halcyone. They were very happy
      together, and according to Pseudo-Apollodorus's account, often
      called each other "Zeus" and "Hera".

    If that doesn't impress you a lot, then you just assume that the
    name has been chosen because both halcyon and ceyx are kingfisher
    birds. Pythons happen to love kingfishers :-).
